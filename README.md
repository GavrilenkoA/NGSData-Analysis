  The Illumina data significantly exceeds the Pacbio data metrics because the Illumina sequencing technology is more accurate. The short reads generated by Illumina sequencing result in a high coverage, which allows the error-detection algorithm to identify sequencing errors more accurately.
The hybrid build demonstrates the best quality. Long reads generated by Pacbio sequencing with extensive coverage enable the resolution of long repetitions, which are vulnerable to errors when using only short Illumina reads.
